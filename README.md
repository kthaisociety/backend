## Git Workflow

This project adheres to [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) for commit messages. This is to ensure that the project is easily maintainable and that the commit history is clean and easy to understand.

### Complete Workflow: From Issue to Merged PR

1. **Issue Assignment**
   - Assign yourself to an issue from our [project board](https://github.com/orgs/kthaisociety/projects/2)
   - Team members can self-assign issues or may be tasked with specific issues during workshops/meetings

2. **Project Management**
   - Ensure the issue is added to our [project view](https://github.com/orgs/kthaisociety/projects/2)
   - Update the issue status to "In Progress" when you start working on it

3. **Branch Creation & Development**
   - Check out the project locally
   - Name your branch either `issue-X` (where X is the issue number) or use GitHub's "Create a branch" feature
   - Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) for commit messages
   - Include `fixes #X` in your commit message if it fixes issue X
   - Example commit message:
     ```
     ci: add deployment notification to Mattermost
     
     * notify on mattermost upon deployment
     
     fixes #17
     ```

4. **Pull Request Creation**
   - Create a pull request when your work is ready for review
   - Use "Draft Pull Request" if you want early feedback but the work is not yet complete

5. **Code Review Process**
   - Request reviews in the team Mattermost channel
   - Primary reviewer is typically the Head of IT
   - The review process may involve multiple rounds of feedback and changes
   - It is generally the responsibility of the PR creator to merge once approved
   - Coordinate with Head of IT before merging if it triggers a production deployment
   - All merges should be squashed

6. **Showcase**
   - Present your completed work during the next team meeting
